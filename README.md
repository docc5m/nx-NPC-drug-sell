# [ESX] NPC Drug Sell

A script that allows you to sell drugs to NPC's. It was thought as a business for gangs or as a red zone where gangs can fight with each other.

If you need help you can ask for help. A premise, this is my first script after 3 weeks of experience, so don't blame me :D .

🚀 Easily configurable with config.lua
